Undoing and Redoing Changes
===========================

You may undo and redo changes you make to the puzzle. Changes include:

- typing a letter in the grid
- making a box blank or non-blank
- selecting a suggested answer
- selecting a quick layout
- entering a clue
- autofilling the grid

Changes that have been undone may be redone by clicking on the Redo
icon. The Redo history is limited to the point of making an undo-able
change.
